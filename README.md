# Console5's CXA1145 Genesis S-video mod

Just working through installing this thing and there's not too much info on it. Making this because I'm not finding an "idiots guide to installing the mod". There was 1 youtube video, and right as he got to the relevant part, he cut away and just said "eh, you'll figure it out"... Well I guess I did.

### CXA1145 Pinout and some other info
